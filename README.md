# Random Password Generator

## Purpose and Functionality
This site uses JavaScript to generate a random password for the user.  The application prompts the user through a series of questions to retrieve password complexity data.  
* The user is prompted for a password length.
* The user is prompted for which characters to include in the password.
    * UPPERCASE
    * lowercase
    * symbols (!, ^, &, #, *, %, @, $)
    * numbers
* The application verifies that appropriate inputs were provided by the user (password length is a number between 8 and 128 (inclusive), and at least one character set was selected by the user)
* The application iterates against a for loop to build a string 

## Key Learnings
* strengthening JS skills including:
    * how to use prompts, confirms, and alerts
    * more familiarity with general syntax
    * function writing and executing
    * data input validation using logical operators 
*
